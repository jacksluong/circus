# Circus
 
Welcome, Welcome, Welcome ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages!  The circus is in town and wow are there some doozies in it!  We have everything to thrill and amaze you from the bearded woman to the flying –olini’s.  Come one and all as they defy gravity in the heavens, tame ferocious lions, dive into glasses of water, sort multiple arrays, and even use pointers in an octopus style to simulate an alphabetic and numeric sorted list!  Yes, it is truly amazing. 
 
Your mission is to design a program that does the following:
 
(1)  You are to read in from the file CircusEmployees.txt all the employees information.  It is broken up into the 
emplyoee’s name (first, last, and midInitial [# if none]).  Also, you are to read in a numerical ID, their category, and their title.  For example:
 
> Marques Paul J&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;012-345-678&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Entertainer&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ring _Master
 
(2)  With this list you are to do the following from the Menu:
 
&emsp;&emsp;(1) Print list alphabetically \
&emsp;&emsp;(2)	Print list by IdNum \
&emsp;&emsp;(3)	Insert new Employee \
&emsp;&emsp;(4) Delete an Employee \
&emsp;&emsp;(5) Print only a particular category list of employees alphabetically \
&emsp;&emsp;(6) Print entire list of all employees by category alphabetically \
&emsp;&emsp;(7) Add a category \
&emsp;&emsp;(8) Delete a category (and ALL corresponding employees) \
&emsp;&emsp;(9) Quit
